# Finding Unicorns With Web Traffic Data

### Authors: Adonis Abdullah

For my data science master's capstone, I created a tool that investors at Old Well Partners could use to make better investment decisions and more easily find trending startups. This project leveraged the SimilarWeb API Wrapper that I developed for the company, and this project helped to solve the problem of keeping up with all the data that has emerged across finance. The automated reports detail a company's current web traffic health, where it is headed in the future, and how that web traffic trends will impact their company valuation.
